# Computation of epidemic final size distributions

This code is provided in support of the paper: Black, A. J. and Ross, J. V. (2015) Computation of epidemic final size distributions, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 367, 159-165.  [doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.029](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.029).

This code is provided to give the exact algorithms used in the paper. In some cases these are not fully optimized for clarity. MATLAB is used throughout for its readability, but much better performance can be obtained by using a compiled language such as C. This is especially true where many loops are involved such as with the SI(4)R model. We request that anyone making use of the code cites the paper.
